Store any type of metadata</h2><p id="6dec" class="mx my ci ap mz b na of nc og ne oh ng oi ni oj nk" data-selectable-paragraph="">With a cookie-based approach, you simply store the session ID in a cookie.

Single calls to database</h2><p id="43f6" class="mx my ci ap mz b na of nc og ne oh ng oi ni oj nk" data-selectable-paragraph="">When using cookie-based authentication, the back end has to do a lookup, whether that be a traditional SQL database or a NoSQL alternative, and the roundtrip is likely to take longer compared to decoding a token.</p><p id="5643" class="mx my ci ap mz b na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Additionally, as you can store additional data inside the JWT, such as the user’s permission level, you can save yourself additional lookup calls to get and process the requested data.</p><p id="0a10" class="mx my ci ap mz b na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk" data-selectable-paragraph="">For example, say you had an API resource <code class="mk ow ox oy oz b">/api/orders</code> that retrieves the latest orders placed via your app, but only users with the role of admin have access to view this data.</p><p id="d8ed" class="mx my ci ap mz b na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk" data-selectable-paragraph="">In a cookie-based approach, once the request is made you’d have one call to the database to verify that the session is valid, another to get the user data and verify that the user has the role of admin, and finally a third call to get the data.</p><p id="093c" class="mx my ci ap mz b na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk" data-selectable-paragraph="">On the other hand, with a JWT approach, you can store the user role in the JWT, so once the request is made and the JWT verified, you can make a single call to the database to retrieve the orders.</p><h2 id="1abe" class="pc nt ci ap ao eu pd pe pf pg ph pi pj pk pl pm pn" data-selectable-paragraph="">4.
