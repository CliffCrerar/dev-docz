Graph QL Databases
==================

## Principles of GraphQL

GraphQL, despite the name, isn't simply a query language. It's a comprehensive solution to the problem of connecting modern apps to services in the cloud. As such, it forms the basis for a new and important layer in the modern application development stack: the data graph. This new layer brings all of a company's app data and services together in one place, with one consistent, secure, and easy-to-use interface, so that anyone can draw upon it with minimal friction.
