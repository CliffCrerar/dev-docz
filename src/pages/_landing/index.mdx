This is a completely personal account, if you are stumbling upon it I hope you find it useful but do not expect it to make sense. It is my dumping ground for things because my browser bookmarks are so crowded it no longer has value, I try and organise things here wherever I can. If you do not like digging through possibly useful nonsense please do not feel bad to swiftly move along.
