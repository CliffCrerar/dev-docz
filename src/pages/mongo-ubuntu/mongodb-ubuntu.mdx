# Installing MongoDB on ubuntu

## TODO . . . .

# Installing MongoDB on MacOS

```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew

brew install mongodb-community@4.0
```

In addition to the binaries, the install creates:

the configuration file (/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf)
the log directory path (/usr/local/var/log/mongodb)
the data directory path (/usr/local/var/mongodb)

### Running mongo

```bash
mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf
```

> Alternatively, to run MongoDB as a macOS service, issue the following (the process uses the /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf file, created during the install):

```bash
brew services start mongodb-community@4.0
```

#### Connect and Use MongoDB

To begin using MongoDB, connect a mongo shell to the running instance. From a new terminal, issue the following:

```bash
mongo
```
